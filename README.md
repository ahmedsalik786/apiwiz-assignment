Real-time Text Analyzer
Overview
Real-time Text Analyzer is a web application designed to provide instant metrics about the text input by the user. It dynamically calculates and displays information such as the number of characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, spaces, and punctuations in the text, updating these metrics as the user types or modifies the input. This project is built using React and showcases real-time data processing and UI updating.

Features
Real-time Analysis: Instant calculation of text metrics without the need for a submit button.
Multi-input Support: Supports analysis of both single words and paragraphs.
Dynamic UI Updates: The user interface updates dynamically with each keystroke, providing immediate feedback.
